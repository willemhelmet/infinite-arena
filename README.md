# FastH3 Episodes — multi-scene video on the fast-h3 clip queue

A clean Next.js + TypeScript starting point built on
[`@reactor-models/fast-h3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reactor-models/fast-h3).
You compose an **episode** — one idea, a scene count you pick — and the app
queues it on the model as **chained scenes** (`continue_from_clip_id`), so
the whole episode plays as one continuous video with no cuts to black
between scenes. Scenes are written by an optional server-side AI writer
(your own OpenAI-compatible key) or by hand, with the app guiding you
through the prompting rules that keep chained video sharp.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local   # add REACTOR_API_KEY=rk_... (+ OPENAI_API_KEY, optional)
pnpm install
pnpm dev                     # http://localhost:3000
```

## What you can do with it

- **Compose episodes.** Pick a scene count (1-6), type an idea (or use a
  preset), and either let the AI writer draft the scenes or write each one
  yourself. Every scene is editable before anything is queued.
- **Play them as one continuous video.** Scenes are enqueued chained — each
  clip opens on the previous clip's last frame — and autoplay hands each
  scene over seamlessly.
- **Compose offline, connect on demand.** Nothing touches the model until
  you click "Queue episode"; the session starts right then.
- **See the queues live.** The queue panel mirrors the model's generation
  (building) and playout (ready) queues, with per-clip remove; capacity
  limits are checked before queueing and refusals are surfaced, never
  silent.
- **Snap a clip.** Capture the last 10 seconds of the live stream as an
  MP4 download.

## Going further

[`skill/SKILL.md`](skill/SKILL.md) is the deep dive for extending the app:
the model's queue contract, the chaining rules and why hard cuts are
load-bearing, the auth pattern, and a table of every model knob this app
deliberately doesn't ship (seeds, clip lengths, canvas, starting images,
flush behaviour) with the typed method to add each one.
